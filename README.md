scraping and analysis of FDA Drugs Approvals data

Shortly idea is that  approval of drug by FDA can have some predictive power for trading of stocks.
First part is to get data as date of approval, company, drug, data and also some financial data like market capitalisation, prices before approval, prices after approval and so on.

When dataset will be completed, try to find some model which can be used for prediction if shares of the company will raise or fall and ideally make some money by investing :D

And final part writing bot which FDA announce approval will buy shares via Degiro ( or XTB if possible)
